Table Tennis Scoreboard Web App
Description

This is a simple web application designed to track and manage scores for a two-player table tennis game. The app allows players to increase or decrease their scores, reset the game, and automatically determines the winner when a player reaches at least 11 points with a lead of 2 or more points.

Features

The app allows tracking scores for two players in real-time. Each player has buttons to add or subtract points. The winner is automatically announced when the winning conditions are met. There is also a reset button to start a new game. The layout is responsive and uses different colors for each player.

How to Use

Open the index.html file in a web browser. Use the +1 and -1 buttons to update each player’s score. When a player reaches 11 points and is at least 2 points ahead, a winner is announced. Click the Reset button to start a new game at any time.

File Structure

The project contains three main files: index.html for the structure, score-board.css for styling, and score-board.js for the JavaScript logic.

Customization

You can change the winning score or lead requirement by modifying the checkWinner() function in score-board.js. Player colors and styles can be adjusted in score-board.css.

Technologies Used

The app uses HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity.
